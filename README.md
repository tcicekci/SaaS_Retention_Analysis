# SaaS User Retention & Engagement Analysis

🌟 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes user activity and retention in a simulated SaaS platform. Using a synthetic dataset, I explored key business questions to identify engagement drivers, understand user behavior, and provide actionable insights for improving product retention and trial conversion rates.

### Business Questions Answered
- What is our monthly retention rate?
- Which features are most common among retained users?
- Are trial users converting to paid plans, and what behaviors drive conversion?

---

📊 **Key Findings**
- **Trial Conversion:** Our trial-to-paid conversion rate is 75.16%. Users who convert typically engage with the product earlier in their trial and use the report generation feature more frequently.  
- **Retention Drivers:** Analysis of retained vs. churned users revealed that features like data upload and dashboard view are highly correlated with long-term user retention.  
- **Retention Curve:** The monthly retention rate for our user cohorts tends to stabilize after few months, suggesting a core group of highly engaged users.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python:** Used for data generation, cleaning, and in-depth analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn libraries).  
- **Tableau:** Created interactive dashboards and visualizations, including a retention heatmap and usage pattern charts.

📁 **Repository Structure**
- `Data/`: Contains the synthetic `users.csv` and `events.csv` datasets.  
- `Code/`: Includes the Jupyter Notebook or Python script with the full code for data cleaning and analysis.
